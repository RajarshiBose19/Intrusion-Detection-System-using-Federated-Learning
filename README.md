# Intrusion Detection Using Federated Learning

## Overview

This project implements an intrusion detection system using federated learning. The goal is to train machine learning models on decentralized edge devices, ensuring privacy and security, and then aggregate these models on a central server to improve the overall intrusion detection system.
