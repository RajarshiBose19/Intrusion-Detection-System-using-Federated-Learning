# Intrusion Detection Using Federated Learning

## Overview

This project implements an intrusion detection system using federated learning. The goal is to train machine learning models on decentralized edge devices, ensuring privacy and security, and then aggregate these models on a central server to improve the overall intrusion detection system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.x
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python Package Installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/intrusion-detection-federated-learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd intrusion-detection-federated-learning
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Describe how to use your project. Include steps for data preprocessing, model training, and any other relevant details.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Data

The project uses the [CICIDS2017 dataset](dataset-link), provided by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System 2017. You can download the dataset [here](dataset-link) and follow the instructions for data preparation in the `data/` directory.

## Model Training

The model training process involves several steps, including feature selection, SMOTE analysis, outlier detection using the Isolation Forest classifier, and federated learning on edge devices. The central server aggregates the models, and the results are stored for analysis.

## Results and Evaluation

The project evaluates the performance of the intrusion detection system using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Results are presented in the `results/` directory, and visualizations are generated using data visualization libraries.
